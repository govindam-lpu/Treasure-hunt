# Treasure-hunt
 Find Treasures or Bombs

So here is the idea. You have three levels to select from. Easy, medium and hard.
Each level contains the respective level of n x n matrix. Wherein the bombs are hidden and so is the prize.
Your job? 
Find the prize and get your score. Not as easy as it seems. 

Oh and dont forget. There is a deadly bomb in there. You click it. GAME OVER!

HAPPY HUNTING!
